\section{Introduction}

*** Explanation about Cryptocurrencies *** 
% Cryptocurrencies are a kind of digital assets based on crypto- graphic protocols and technologies, such as the blockchain, that run on decentralized networks and make transactions secure and difficult to fake

Despite the rapidly increasing amount of \emph{altcoins} (short for alternative-coins) on the cryptocurrencies market, \emph{BTC} and \emph{ETH} are still the leading coins in a terms of market dominance of 43.6\% for \emph{BTC} and 18\% for \emph{ETH} according to \emph{coinmarketcap} *** at the time of writing this paper. link to the site (?)***

With this significant market share, said coins has a measurable impact of the other \emph{altcoins} price movement. We set out to quantify said impact by calculating the \emph{Transfer Entropy} between different coin pair on different *** candle sizes ***.

Transfer Entropy is defined as

$T_{X\rightarrow Y} = H\left( Y_t \mid Y_{t-1:t-L}\right) - H\left( Y_t \mid Y_{t-1:t-L}, X_{t-1:t-L}\right)$


*** should we explain about candles? ***
*** add explanation about abnormality - explain about ATR ***
